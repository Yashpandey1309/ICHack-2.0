          Our Team Logic Lords have been working on the project to save the
          energy consumption in a house by keeping a record of all the power
          consumption and making sure that there is wise consumption of power.
          Also in our platform we will be providing a facility to check for solar panels
          and Blogs for educational Purpose.

        <p class="text1 description">
          Our idea revolves around the development of a platform which would
          include the following key features: 
        <ul>
            <li class="items">1) Measuring the over consumption of energy at our households and switching to solar panels when exceeding the set limit. </li>
            <li class="items">2) Installation of solar panels by taking in accordance of the area that we live around and evaluating the cost required.</li>
            <li class="items">3) Educational platform which tells about productively applying the 3Rs in regards with energy consumption.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="Goals">
        <h1 class="heading">Our Goal</h1>
        <p class="text1 description">
            Our Goal is to reduce carbon emission by 50% from households and other areas and achieve a greater environment for our Future generation.
            It will also help to reduce power consumption by helping the user to notice how much power do they consume on daily basis.
            Also if they can switch to an alternative power  supply like solar energy.
